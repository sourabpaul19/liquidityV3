                    <p><strong>Reservations:</strong> The feature of the Services is to assist you with placing your Order by selecting from variety of products listed and offered for sale and a reservation (&quot;Reservation&quot;) after placing your Order at participating third party restaurants (each, a &quot;Participating Outlet&quot;). You may book an Order and Reservation at a Participating Outlet only between 11.30AM and 11.30PM of any day (the &quot;Booking Hours&quot;), except the days when sale of alcohol is prohibited as per the respective State/ Central laws, rules, regulations or notifications. You shall be provided with real-time price fluctuations of the alcoholic beverages across Participating Restaurants based on the demand of such alcoholic beverages and users may opt to place their Orders on such price as shown in the App as well as include food and other items in their Order. The bill amount (the &quot;Bill Amount&quot;) shall include price of the alcoholic beverage as shown in the App, price of food or any other items ordered by you as well as any additional prime time service charges which may be charged by Participating Outlets. You shall make payment of the Bill Amount at the time of booking your Order and Reservation. Reservation containing the Order at a Participating Outlet may be made by you upto 3 (Three) days in advance during the Booking Hours only. The User may book an Order and Reservation either for himself, or for other persons after providing necessary information about such parties. The User shall indicate the number of guests the User intends to bring at the Participating Outlet, or the number of guests for whom the User is making an Order and Reservation and the User and/ or the persons for whom the Order and Reservation has been made by the User, will abide by such indicated number of guests. However, Liquidity may limit the number of guests commensurate with the Order placed by the User. When you request a Reservation at a Participating Outlet, the Reservation is not confirmed until you receive a confirmation on or through the Services. Once confirmed, you agree to honor the Reservation by arriving on time and by paying for your meal. You also agree not to book more than one Reservation for your personal use during any one meal time and agree that you will not resell or attempt to resell any Reservations made through the Services. You also agree that you shall not violate the age restrictions for consuming any alcoholic beverages imposed by respective State laws, rules, regulations or notifications and you shall produce a valid age proof before the Participating Outlet if demanded by such Participating Outlet. A Participating Outlet shall be entitled to refuse to serve any alcoholic beverages to you in case you have ordered for alcoholic beverages in violation of the said age restrictions. You also agree to consume any alcoholic beverages ordered by you within the premises of the Participating Outlet and not to carry or consume any such alcoholic beverages outside the premises of the Participating Outlet. The Participating Outlets may stipulate dress codes and gate policies and you agree to adhere to the applicable dress code or gate policy. You also agree that your order (&quot;Order&quot;) with your Reservation will not be allowed to be modified after you have placed your request for Reservation. If you require rescheduling of a confirmed Reservation, please email us at resolve@liquiditybars.com or use the Application. We will work with the Participating Outlet to reschedule as requested; however, please note that Participating Outlets cannot always accommodate rescheduling and all rescheduling requests are subject to availability and confirmation by the Participating Outlet and any rescheduling requested by you shall be charged a rescheduling fee (&quot;Rescheduling Fee&quot;). Your Reservation shall be allowed to be rescheduled only once and such reservation will not be allowed to be rescheduled any further or cancelled under any circumstances at all. By providing your e-mail address and mobile phone number during the account registration process, you are consenting to receive communications (including SMS text messages) from Liquidity at that e-mail address and mobile phone number, including but not limited to communications about reservation requests and rescheduling of reservations. In the event the Participating Outlet is unable to provide the product ordered by you, you shall be offered a suitable alternative at a similar or higher price. You may refuse to accept such alternative product offered, in which case, you shall be given a refund of the entire Bill Amount.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Cancellations and Missed Reservations:</strong> Once your Reservation is confirmed, however, the Participating Outlet is setting aside alcoholic beverages, food, and a table especially for you (if applicable) and you agree to honour the Reservation by arriving at the Participating Outlet on time. Although we understand that plans change, if you cannot honour a confirmed Reservation, you must cancel that Reservation through the Services within fifteen (15) minutes from the confirmation of your reservation. If you cancel a reservation afterwards with at least one (1) hour remaining before the start time, it will be considered as a late cancellation (&quot;Late Cancellation&quot;) and you shall be charged a fee of 25% of the Bill Amount for such Late Cancellation (&quot;Late Cancellation Fee&quot;), in our discretion. If you cancel a Reservation with one (1) hour but not more than 30 (Thirty) minutes remaining until your start time, it will be considered as a Late Cancellation and you shall be charged a Late Cancellation Fee of 50% of the Bill Amount for such Late Cancellation, in our discretion. If you do not cancel your reservation thirty (30) minutes before the start time and/ or fail to arrive at the restaurant, we may consider that a missed reservation (&quot;Missed Reservation&quot;) and may charge a fee of the entire Bill Amount for such Missed Reservation (&quot;Missed Reservation Fee&quot;), in our discretion. Late Cancellation Fee and Missed Reservation Fee shall not include the applicable taxes paid towards the Bill Amount, and amount paid towards applicable taxes by you shall be refunded. Late Cancellations and Missed Reservations may be associated with your Account. To maintain a high level of service for all Liquidity Users and Participating Outlets, Accounts with multiple Late Cancellations and/or Missed Reservations may be deactivated. If you believe that a Late Cancellation and/or Missed Reservation has been erroneously associated with your Account, you may dispute it by contacting us at resolve@liquiditybars.com. You agree that all final determinations regarding Late Cancellations and Missed Reservations, including with respect to any fees charged for the same, will be made by Liquidity in its sole discretion. Liquidity passes on part of all Late Cancellation Fees and Missed Reservation Fees it charges to the affected Participating Outlet to help defray costs. Please note that some Participating Outlets may have Additional Prime Time Service charges which will be viewable on the Services before you request a reservation. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, we (and any Participating Outlet at which you have made a reservation with through the Services) reserve the right to cancel your reservation if you do not check in within fifteen (15) minutes after your reservation time.</p>
